    <h3>A Bit About Me!</h3>
    <p>To start, let me introduce myself! My name is Max Jones; I've lived in Utah for most of my life. I'm the
    middle child of three, older, half-siblings and two, younger siblings. I'm nineteen years old and currently
    attending my second semester of college; my major is in Computer Science. For my hobbies I draw, craft, game,
    and binge-watch my current favorite shows (Bob's Burgers & Ghosts). My favorite types of games are story-games
    like Red Dead Redemption, Disco Elysium, and many more. I do like some first-person shooters like Overwatch.</p>
